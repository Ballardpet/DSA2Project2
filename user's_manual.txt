probably say something like:
    analytical model class works as expected
    ran out of time and was not able to properly complete simulator class (mabye describe what sim should do)

Setup and Compilation
1. Download and unzip the file from Canvas.
2. This submission should include
    *analyticalModel.cpp
    *analyticalModel.hpp
    *customer.cpp
    *customer.hpp
    *fifoQueue.cpp
    *fifoQueue.hpp
    *main.cpp
    *Makefile
    *priorityQueue.cpp
    *priorityQueue.hpp
    *simulator.cpp
    *simulator.hpp
    *sysnet1 UML.png
    *test1.txt (The input file for test 1)
    *test2.txt (The input file for test 2)
    *user's_manual.txt (this file)
3. Environment: This program has been tested in the mult-platform lab and will run there
4. Compiling: This program includes a Makefile. At the command line in Linux, type make. 
    The program will compile an executale name "main"


Running the program: Be sure that "test1.txt" and "test2.txt" are in the same directory as the executable. 
Issue the command "./main". No command line arguments are required or checked.

User Input: No user input is required for this program.

Output: This program will output the results of the test to the command line. The results for test 1 on analyticalModel
and simulator will be displayed first, followed by the results for test 2. The command line output will similar
to the following:
